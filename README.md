Requires the Love game engine (https://love2d.org/)

This is a work in progress (WOP). Games were built under the direction of Kyle Schaub (https://www.udemy.com/course/lua-love)

What was changed:

- Assets will be swapped out.
- Resolution size will be identical between games and the main menu.
- New enemies will be added in the Top Down Shooter and Platformer games.
- New levels will be added to the Platformer game.
- Main Menu will be more interactive.
- A few bugs will be fixed.

Bug Resolution:
- Highest Score will be shown after death in the Top Down Shooter game.
- Returning to the Main Menu from a game will become available.
- Enemies spawn in random places upon death on the Platformer game.
